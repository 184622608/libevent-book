Working with events
-------------------

Libevent's basic unit of operation is the 'event'.  Every event
represents a set of conditions, including:

   - A file descriptor being ready to read from or write to.
   - A file descriptor _becoming_ ready to read from or write to
     (Edge-triggered IO only).
   - A timeout expiring.
   - A signal occurring.
   - A user-triggered event.

Events have similar lifecycles.  Once you call a Libevent function to
set up an event and associate it with an event base, it becomes
*initialized*.  At this point, you can 'add', which makes it
*pending*.  in the base.  When the event is pending, if the conditions
that would trigger an event occur (e.g., its file descriptor changes
state or its timeout expires), the event becomes *active*, and its
(user-provided) callback function is run.  If the event is configured
*persistent*, it remains pending.  If it is not persistent, it stops
being pending when its callback runs.  You can make a pending event
non-pending by 'deleting' it, and you can 'add' a non-pending event to
make it pending again.

Constructing event objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new event, use the event_new() interface.

.Interface
[code]
--------
#define EV_TIMEOUT      0x01
#define EV_READ         0x02
v#define EV_WRITE        0x04
#define EV_SIGNAL       0x08
#define EV_PERSIST      0x10
#define EV_ET           0x20

struct event *event_new(struct event_base *base, evutil_socket_t fd,
    short what, void (*cb)(evutil_socket_t, short, void *),
    void *arg);

void event_free(struct event *event);
--------

The event_new() function tries to allocate and construct a new event
for use with 'base'.  The 'what' argument is a set of the flags listed
above.  (Their semantics are described below.)  If 'fd' is
nonnegative, it is the file that we'll observe for read or write
events.  When the event is active, Libevent will invoke the provided
'cb' function, passing it as arguments: the file descriptor 'fd', a
bitfield of _all_ the events that triggered, and the value that was passed
in for 'arg' when the function was constructed.

On an internal error, or invalid arguments, event_new() will return NULL.

All new events are initialized and non-pending.  To make an event
pending, call event_add() (documented below).

To deallocate an event, call event_free().  It is safe to call
event_free() on an event that is pending or active: doing do makes the
event non-pending and in-active befrore deallocating it.

.Example
[code]
--------
void cb_func(evutil_socket_t fd, short what, void *arg)
{
        const char *data = arg;
        printf("Got an event on socket %d:%s%s%s%s [%s]",
            (int fd),
            (what&EV_TIMEOUT) ? " timeout" : "",
            (what&EV_READ)    ? " read" : "",
            (what&EV_WRITE)   ? " write" : "",
            (what&EV_WRITE)   ? " signal" : "",
            data);
}

...

evutil_socket_t fd1, fd2;
struct event *ev1, *ev2;
struct timeval five_seconds = {5,0};
struct event_base *base = event_base_new();

/* set up fd1, fd2 somehow, and make them nonblocking. */

ev1 = event_new(base, fd1, EV_TIMEOUT|EV_READ|EV_PERSIST, cb_func,
        "Reading event");
ev2 = event_new(base, fd2, EV_WRITE|EV_PERSIST, cb_func,
        "Writing event");

event_add(ev1, &five_seconds);
event_add(ev2, NULL);
event_base_dispatch();
--------

The above functions are defined in <event2/event.h>, and first
appeared in Libevent 2.0.1-alpha.

The event flags
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

EV_TIMEOUT::
    This flag indicates an event that becomes active after a timeout
    elapses.

    The EV_TIMEOUT flag is ignored when constructing an event: you
    can either set a timeout when you add the event, or not.  It is
    set in the 'what' argument to the callback function when a timeout
    has occurred.
    [FIXME: Is this correct?]

EV_READ::
    This flag indicates an event that becomes active when the provided
    file descriptor is ready for reading.

EV_WRITE::
    This flag indicates an event that becomes active when the provided
    file descriptor is ready for writing.

EV_SIGNAL::
    Used to implement signal detection.  See "FIXME" below.

EV_PERSIST::
    Indicates that the event is 'persistent'.  See "About Event
    Persistence" below.

EV_ET::
    Indicates that the event should be edge-triggered, if the
    underlying event_base backend supports edge-triggered events.
    This affects the semantics of EV_READ and EV_WRITE.

Since Libevent 2.0.1-alpha, any number of events may be pending for
the same conditions at the same time.  For example, you may have two
events that will become active if a given fd becomes ready to read.
The order in which their callbacks are run is undefined.

These flags are defined in <event2/event.h>.  All have existed since
before Libevent 1.0, except for EV_ET, which was introduced in
Libevent 2.0.1-alpha.

About Event Persistence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, whenever a pending event becomes active (because its fd is
ready to read or write, or because its timeout expires), it becomes
non-pending right before its
callback is executed.  Thus, if you want to make the event pending
again, it is sufficient to call event_add() on it again from inside
the callback function.

If the EV_PERSIST flag is set on an event, however, the event is
'persistent.'  In other words, the event remains pending even when its
callback runs.  If you want to make it non-pending from within its
callback, you can call event_del() on it.

The timeout on a persistent event resets whenever the event's callback
runs.  Thus, if you have an event with flags EV_READ|EV_PERSIST and a
timeout of five seconds, the event will become active:
  - Whenever the socket is ready for reading.
  - Whenever five seconds have passed since the event last was active.

Timeout-only events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As a convenience, you can use the evtimer_new to allocate a
pure-timeout event:

.Interface
[code]
--------
#define evtimer_new(base, callback, arg) \
    event_new(base, -1, 0, callback, arg)
--------

FIXME: Say more.


Constructing signal events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Libevent can also watch for POSIX-style signals.  To construct a
handler for a signal, use:

.Interface
[code]
--------
#define evsignal_new(base, signum, callback, arg) \
    event_new(base, signum, EV_SIGNAL|EV_PERSIST, cb, arg)
--------

The arguments are as for event_new, except that we provide a signal
number instead of a file descriptor.

.Example
[code]
--------
struct event *hup_event;

/* call sighup_function on a HUP signal */
hup_event = evsignal_new(base, SIGHUP, sighup_function, NULL);
--------

Note that signal callbacks are run in the event loop after the signal
occurs, so it is safe for them to call functions that you are not
supposed to call from a regular POSIX signal handler.

WARNING: Don't set a timeout on a signal event.  It might not be
supported.  FIXME: true?

Stack- and struct-allocated events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For performance and other reasons, some people like to allocate event
structures on the stack, or as a part of a larger structure.  This
saves them the cost of a pointer reference here and here, but at the
risk of breaking their binaries' compatibility with other versions of
of Libevent, which may have different sizes for the event structure.

You shouldn't do this unless you *know* that you're incurring an
actual performance penalty for heap-allocating your events.  Using
this function can cause hard-do-diagnose errors with future versions
of Libevent if they use a larger event structure than the one you're
building with.

.Interface
[code]
--------
void event_assign(struct event *event, struct event_base *base,
    evutil_socket_t fd, short what,
    void (*callback)(evutil_socket_t, short, void *), void *arg);
--------

All the arguments of event_assign() are as for event_new(), except for
the 'event' argument, which must point to an uninitialized event.

.Example
[code]
--------
struct event_pair {
         evutil_socket_t fd;
         struct event read_event;
         struct event write_event;
};
static void readcb(evutil_socket_t, short, void *);
static void writecb(evutil_socket_t, short, void *);
struct event_pair *event_pair_new(struct event_base *base, evutil_socket_t fd)
{
        struct event_pair *p = malloc(sizeof(struct event_pair));
        if (!p) return NULL;
        p->fd = fd;
        event_assign(&p->read_event, base, fd, EV_READ|EV_PERSIST, readcb, p);
        event_assign(&p->read_event, base, fd, EV_WRITE|EV_PERSIST, writecb, p);
        return p;
}
--------

This function is defined in <event2/event.h>.  It has existed since
Libevent 2.0.1-alpha.  The event structure itself is defined in
<event2/event_struct.h>.

Making events pending and non-pending
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have constructed an event, it won't actually do anything
until you have made it 'pending' by adding it.  You do this with
event_add:

.Interface
[code]
--------
int event_add(struct event *ev, const struct timeval *tv);
--------

Calling event_add on a non-pending event makes it pending in its
configured base.  If it is already pending, there is no effect.  The
function returns 0 on success, and -1 on failure.  If 'tv' is NULL,
the event is added with no timeout.  Otherwise, 'tv' is the size of
the timeout in seconds and microseconds.

NOTE: Do not set 'tv' to the time at which you want the timeout to
run.  If you say "tv->tv_sec = time(NULL)+10;" on 1 January 2010, your
timeout will wait 40 years, not 10 seconds.

.Interface
[code]
--------
int event_del(struct event *ev);
--------

Calling event_del on an initialized event makes it non-pending and
non-active.  If the event was not pending or active, there is no
effect.  The return value is 0 on success, -1 on failure.

NOTE: If you delete an event after it becomes active but before
its callback has a chance to executes, the callback will not be
executed.

These functions are defined in <event2/event.h>; they have existed
since before Libevent 1.0.

Events with priorities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When multiple events trigger at the same time, Libevent does not
define any order with respect to when their callbacks will be
executed.  You can define some events as more important than others by
using priorities.

As discussed in an earlier section, each event_base has one or more
priority values associated with it.  Before adding an event to the
event_base, but after initializing it, you can set its priority.

.Interface
[code]
----------
int event_priority_set(struct event *event, int priority);
----------

The priority of the event is a number between 0 and the number of
priorities in an event_base, minus 1.  The function returns 0 on
success, and -1 on failure.

When multiple events of multiple priorities become active, the
low-priority events are not run.  Instead, Libevent runs the high
priority events, then checks for events again.  Only when no
high-priority events are active are the low-priority events run.

.Example
[code]
----------
struct event *important, *unimportant;
struct event_base *base;

base = event_base_new();
event_base_priority_init(base, 2);
/* Now base has priority 0, and priority 1 */
important = event_new(base, fd, EV_WRITE|EVPERSIST, write_cb, NULL);
unimportant = event_new(base, fd, EV_READ|EVPERSIST, read_cb, NULL);
event_priority_set(important, 0);
event_priority_set(unimportant, 1);

/* Now, whenever the fd is ready for writing, the write callback will
   happen before the read callback.  The read callback won't happen at
   all until the write callback is no longer active. */
----------

When you do not set the priority for an event, the default is the
number of queues in the event base, divided by 2.

This function is declared in <event2/event.h>.  It has existed since
before Libevent 1.0.

Inspecting event status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you want to tell whether an event has been added, and check
what it refers to.

.Interface
[code]
--------
int event_pending(struct event *ev, short what, struct timeval *tv_out);

#define event_get_signal(ev) /* ... */
evutil_socket_t event_get_fd(struct event *ev);
--------

The event_pending function determines whether the given event is
pending or active.  If it is, and any of the flags EV_READ, EV_WRITE,
EV_SIGNAL, and EV_TIMEOUT are set in the 'what' argument, the function
returns all of the flags that the event is currently pending or active
on.  If 'tv_out' is provided, and EV_TIMEOUT is set in what, and the
event is currently pending or active on a timeout, then 'tv_out' is
set to hold the time when the event's timeout will expire.

The event_get_fd() and event_get_signal() return the configured file
descriptor or signal number for an event.


These functions are declared in <event2/event.h>.  The event_pending()
functions has existed since before Libevent 1.0.  The others are new in
Libevent 2.0.1-alpha.

Configuring one-off events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't need to add an event more than once, or delete it once it
has been added, and it doesn't have to be persistent, you can use
event_base_once().

.Interface
[code]
--------
int event_base_once(struct event_base *, evutil_socket_t, short,
  void (*)(evutil_socket_t, short, void *), void *, const struct timeval *);
--------

This function's interface is the same as event_new(), except that it
does not support EV_SIGNAL or EV_PERSIST.  The scheduled event is
inserted and run with the default priority.  When the callback is
finally done, Libevent frees the internal event structure itself.
The return value is 0 on success, -1 on failure.

Manually activating an event
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rarely, you may want to make an event active even though its
conditions have not triggered.

.Interface
[code]
--------
void event_active(struct event *ev, int what, short ncalls);
--------

This function makes an event 'ev' become active with the flags 'what'
(a combination of EV_READ, EV_WRITE, and EV_TIMEOUT).  The event does
not need to have previously been pending, and activating it does not
make it pending.

This function is defined in <event2/event.h>.  It has existed
since before Libevent 1.0.


// Not yet documented: event_initialized().  Too stupid to use.
