A tiny introduction to asynchronous I/O
----------------------------------------

Most beginning programmers start with synchronous, blocking I/O calls.
An I/O call is _synchronous_ if, when you call it, it does not return
unless and until the operation is completed.  When you call
"connect()" on a TCP connection, for example, your operating system
queues a SYN packet to the host on the other side of the TCP
connection, and does not return control back to your application until
it receives a SYN ACK packet from the opposite host, or until enough
time has passed that it decides to give up.

Here's an example of a really simple syncronous client that writes

Oh gods no.
